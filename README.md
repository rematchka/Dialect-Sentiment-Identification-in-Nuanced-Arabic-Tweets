# Dialect-Sentiment-Identification-in-Nuanced-Arabic-Tweets
This Repository contains work done in NADI shared task 2022.  We achieve first place in both NADI 2022 subtasks by ensembling a set of models built on top Arabic-bert-based models in three settings: (1) prompt-based, (2) single fine-tuning, and multitask fine-tuning.


## Overview
This github is an implementation for accepted manuscript titled `Dialect & Sentiment Identification in Nuanced Arabic Tweets Using an Ensemble of Prompt-based, Fine-tuned, and Multitask BERT-Based Models`.
